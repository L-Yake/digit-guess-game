# Digit Guessing Game

#### -- Project Status: [On-Hold]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to learn a machine learning algorithm and apply it to a real use-case. Objectives for this project include, building a drawing pad application, building and training a Support Vector Model (SVM), and finally synthesizing the applications to recognize user-generated input and report our guess to the user.

### Methods Used
* Supervised Machine Learning
* Data Transformation
* Data Visualization
* Game Development

### Technologies
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Pygame

## Project Description
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is useful for classification or regression problems. In our SVM algorithm, we plot our points in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features our data has) and the algorithm determines which hyper-plane provides the most contrast between classes. Our classes being the images of digits 0-9. Initializing a resizable drawing pad with Python's pygame module, we allow for a user-interface that can capture user inputs (esp. click-and-drag) to generate an array with which the SVM can classify. 

Challenges:
- Dynamically-windowed Application
- Information Compression
- Game Event Management

## Needs of this project
